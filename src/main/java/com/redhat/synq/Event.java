/**
 * An Event represents something that may happen in the future, and can be awaited. Awaiting that
 * Event (via {@link #waitUpTo(Duration)}) returns some result associated with the Event you were
 * waiting for.
 *
 * <p>Events have several default methods for taking an existing an event and composing another
 * from it. Many of them are simply overrides of others for convenient syntax. Here are the core
 * default methods that are ultimately used by the various overrides:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #after(Runnable)} - When this Event is awaited, it will first run the action.</li>
 * <li>{@link #failIf(Event)} - While waiting for the original event, throw an exception if this
 * other event occurs first.</li>
 * <li>{@link #or(Event)} - Returns an Event that will trigger when either of these Events occurs,
 * returning the value associated with whichever happened first.</li>
 * <li>{@link #andThenExpect(Event)} - Returns an Event that will wait for the the original, then
 * wait for the second, in that order.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the result of this Event.

     * specified duration, at which point a {@link com.redhat.synq.TimeoutException} will be
     * thrown.
     *
     * <p>If a wait operation should break, you can interrupt the thread currently waiting. That is,
     * Event implementations must respond to thread interrupts by ceasing to block the thread and
     * returning null. Other Event types use interrupts when they no longer care whether or when
     * a particular Event is satisfied. Interrupts are a means to tell Events to stop doing
     * unnecessary work.
